## 🚀 The Ultimate Browser-Based Image Toolkit

**Image Converter Pro** is a high-performance extension designed for developers, designers, and social media managers. It transforms your browser into a full-featured image processing suite, allowing you to convert, resize, and optimize images without ever leaving your active tab.

Unlike web-based converters that require you to upload sensitive files to their servers, Image Converter Pro performs all operations **100% locally**, ensuring maximum speed and absolute privacy.
