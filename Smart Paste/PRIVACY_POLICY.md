# Privacy Policy for Smart Paste

**Effective Date: February 5, 2026**

At **Smart Paste**, we protect your data while automating your workflow. This policy explains our commitment to your privacy.

## 1. Zero Knowledge Data Handling
**Smart Paste** is a pure utility tool.
*   **No Clipboard Logging**: We do not store or log the text you paste. The data is only held in temporary memory during the active typing session.
*   **No Personal Collection**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information.
*   **No Fingerprinting**: We do not track your device or browser habits.

## 2. Local-Only Processing
All typing simulations occur entirely within your browser's local sandbox. No text, regardless of sensitivity, is ever transmitted to external servers or cloud services.

## 3. Permissions & Justification
*   `scripting`: Required to inject the humanized typing logic into the text fields of the pages you visit.
*   `activeTab`: Allows the extension to interact with the current page only when you explicitly activate it.
*   `storage`: Used solely to save your preferred typing speed and accuracy settings locally.

## 4. Transparency & Security
Smart Paste is open-source and reviewable. We do not use remote code execution, ensuring that the code you install is the only code that runs.

## 5. Contact
