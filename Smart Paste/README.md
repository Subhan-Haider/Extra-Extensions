## 🚀 Beyond Traditional Copy-Paste

**Smart Paste** is a professional-grade browser utility designed to simulate human keystrokes in any text field. Instead of "dumping" text into a box—which can be detected by anti-bot systems or break sensitive input fields—Smart Paste *types* the content for you.

Equipped with a specialized **Ghost-Interval Logic**, Smart Paste allows you to control the rhythm and accuracy of your inputs, making it the ultimate tool for QA testers, automation enthusiasts, and high-speed data entry professionals.

## ✨ Elite Features

| Module | Key Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **👻 Ghost Typing** | Simulates realistic keyboard events (`keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`) for 100% field compatibility. |
| **🏎️ Nitro Speed** | Adjustable millisecond delays—type at a "chill" human pace or hit speeds of **500+ WPM**. |
| **🔄 Auto-Loop** | Seamlessly repeat typing tasks—perfect for infinite stress-testing of web forms. |
| **🎯 Smart Selection** | Paste only into the currently focused element, preventing accidental data dumps in other tabs. |
| **🎨 Glassmorphism UI** | A sleek, modern dashboard that gives you full control over your automation parameters. |
| **⚡ Instant Execution** | No background bloat. Smart Paste triggers the moment you need it and shuts down when you don't. |

## 🎭 Advanced Human Simulation

Smart Paste doesn't just automate; it emulates.
*   **Variable Latency**: Dynamically varies the micro-seconds between every character to mimic the natural un-evenness of human fingers.
*   **Field Triggering**: Correctly triggers all JavaScript event listeners on a page (like "onchange" or "input"), which traditional pasting often fails to do.
*   **Safety Buffer**: Built-in safeguards to prevent browser freezing during high-speed multi-thousand character tasks.

## 📖 Pro User Workflows

### 🧪 For QA & Bug Testing
1.  **Stress Test**: Load a 10,000-word string into Smart Paste.
2.  **Set High Speed**: Set the delay to 1ms.
3.  **Analyze**: Observe how your web application handles a sustained flood of keyboard inputs without a single crash.

### 📝 For Form Automation
1.  **Prep Text**: Copy your standardized data.
2.  **Set Human Pace**: Set the delay to 50ms.
3.  **Run**: Watch the form fill itself naturally, bypassing simple bot-detection that monitors for "Instant Paste" events.
