# Privacy Policy for BlizFlow - Business Management Extension

**Effective Date: February 5, 2026**

At **BlizFlow**, we handle your business data with the highest security and privacy standards.

## 1. Data Collection & Usage
**BlizFlow** is a comprehensive productivity suite designed to keep your business data under your control.
*   **Local-First Storage**: All CRM records, invoices, expenses, and client notes are stored locally on your device.
*   **No Data Mining**: We do not sell your client lists, financial records, or business insights to third parties.
*   **Authentication**: Credentials for auto-login features are encrypted and stored locally. We do not transmit your passwords to our servers.

## 2. Permissions & Justification
*   `storage`: Required to save your business data (CRM, Invoices, Expenses) locally.
*   `activeTab` & `scripting`: Allows for data capture and auto-filling features on the business websites you manage.
*   `notifications`: Used for invoice reminders and budget alerts.
*   `alarms`: Powers recurring billing and scheduled automation tasks.
*   `tabs`: Used to manage and sync your business workspace across multiple tabs.

## 3. Data Sovereignty
Your data belongs to you. You can export your entire database as CSV or JSON at any time from the settings menu. Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored business data unless you have performed a manual backup.

## 4. Security
We use industry-standard encryption for sensitive local data. All network communication (for optional features) is performed over secure HTTPS connections to `blizflow.online` or your specified API endpoints.

## 5. Contact
