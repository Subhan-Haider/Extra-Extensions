## 🔒 Privacy & Security: Our "Zero-Knowledge" Policy

We believe your history is private. Unlike cloud-based clipboard syncers, ClipTrack follows a strict **offline-first** philosophy:
*   🚫 **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your physical machine.
*   🚫 **No Analytics**: We don't track what you COPY, WHERE you copy, or WHO you are.
*   🚫 **No External Calls**: The extension doesn't connect to any remote servers or APIs.
*   ✅ **User-Controlled**: One-click "Clear All" permanently wipes your local history.
*   ✅ **Legal**: View our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

## 🤝 Project Roadmap & Support

We are constantly improving! Our planned features include:
- [ ] **Image Support**: Tracking images in the clipboard history.
- [ ] **Local Encryption**: Password-protect your history database.
- [ ] **Custom Themes**: Create your own Glassmorphism styles.
