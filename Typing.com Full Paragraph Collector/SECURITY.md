# Security Policy: Subhan Extensions

At **Subhan Extensions**, the security of our users and their data is our absolute priority. Being an open-source collection, we rely on transparency and community vigilance to maintain the highest safety standards.

## 🛡️ Our Security Commitment

1.  **Local Isolation**: Every extension in this suite is designed to run in a sandbox. We minimize cross-origin communication to prevent data leakage.
2.  **No Remote Scripts**: We strictly avoid the use of `eval()` or remote script loading (CDN-hosted JS) to eliminate the risk of supply-chain attacks.
3.  **Manifest V3**: All active projects are built on the Manifest V3 standard, which provides enhanced security layers and strictly defined permissions.
4.  **Static Analysis**: We regularly perform code audits to ensure no sensitive data is ever logged or transmitted.

## 🚀 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the two most recent major versions of each extension.

| Version Type | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stable (e.g., v1.x, v4.x)** | ✅ Supported |
| **Previous Major Version** | ⚠️ Limited Support |
| **Legacy Versions** | ❌ Not Supported |
