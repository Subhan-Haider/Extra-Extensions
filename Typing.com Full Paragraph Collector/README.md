## 🚀 Reclaim Your Typing Context

**Typing.com Full Paragraph Collector** is a high-utility browser extension designed specifically for the **Typing.com** platform. While the official interface shows words one-by-one or in fragmented lines, this tool uses intelligent DOM analysis to reconstruct the original, full paragraph in real-time.

Whether you are a competitive typist looking to analyze text complexity, a student wanting to preview difficult sections, or a developer needing clean practice data, this tool provides the "Big Picture" instantly.

## ✨ The Power of Context

### 🧩 Intelligent Paragraph Reconstruction
*   **DOM Harvesting**: Scans the active lesson container to identify and extract word elements.
*   **Coherent Stitching**: Automatically adds appropriate spacing and handles line breaks to present a perfect, readable paragraph.
*   **Dynamic Updates**: Re-scans instantly if the lesson changes, ensuring you always have the latest text.

### ⚡ High-Performance Utility
*   **Zero-Lag Operation**: Built with optimized JavaScript to ensure it doesn't impact your typing WPM or browser responsiveness.
*   **One-Click Export**: Feature a dedicated 'Copy' button inside the popup to send the reconstructed text to your clipboard.
*   **Glassmorphism UI**: A modern, sleek popup design that matches the professional aesthetic of high-end developer tools.

### 🎯 Practice Enhancement
*   **Contextual Preview**: Understand the punctuation and grammar flow of the entire lesson before you start typing.
*   **External Practice**: Take any Typing.com paragraph and use it in your own custom typing software or text editors.
