# Privacy Policy for Chronos: Visual Context Manager

**Effective Date: February 5, 2026**

At **Chronos**, we help you manage your digital context without compromising your privacy.

## 1. Local-First Data Management
**Chronos** is designed to store your project workspaces and tab groups exclusively on your machine.
*   **No Cloud Sync**: We do not upload your URLs, project names, or browsing history to any centralized server.
*   **No Tracking**: We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or cookies to monitor how you organize your projects.

## 2. Permissions & Justification
To provide its core functionality, the extension requires the following permissions:
*   `tabs` & `tabGroups`: Allows the extension to read and organize your active tabs into meaningful visual projects.
*   `storage` & `unlimitedStorage`: Used to save large project workspaces and session details locally on your device.
*   `contextMenus`: Allows you to add the current tab to a specific Chronos project via the right-click menu.
*   `scripting`: Used to enhance the visual presentation of your grouped tabs.

## 3. Data Sovereignty
Your project data belongs to you. If you uninstall the extension, all locally stored data created by Chronos is deleted from your browser. We do not maintain any backups of your data on our end.

## 4. Security
All processing happens within the extension's local sandbox. We do not use remote code execution, ensuring that your browsing environment remains secure.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about our privacy practices, please open an issue on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Subhan-Haider/Extra-Extensions).
