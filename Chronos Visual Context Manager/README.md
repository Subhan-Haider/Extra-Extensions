## 🚀 Stop Losing Tabs. Start Keeping Context.

Between project research, task switching, and daily browsing, our tab bars often become a chaotic graveyard of information. **Chronos** is a professional-grade visual workspace manager that transforms your browser into an organized project hub.

By grouping tabs into **Visual Projects**, Chronos allows you to switch between different work contexts instantly, preserving your mental focus and system resources.

## 💡 The Chronos Advantage

### 🧠 Preserve Your Flow State
Context switching is the #1 productivity killer. Chronos acts as your "external brain," storing every tab, link, and resource exactly where it belongs so you can pick up exactly where you left off.

### 💼 Professional Workflows
1.  **Project Launch**: Create a new project for "Q1 Marketing Campaign" or "AI Research".
2.  **Resource Gathering**: Open all relevant tabs. Chronos automatically associates them with your active context.
3.  **Visual Switching**: Need to pause research to handle an urgent bug? Switch to your "Development" context instantly, then jump back to "Marketing" when you're done.
