# Privacy Policy for Humanize AI

**Effective Date: February 5, 2026**

At **Humanize AI**, we protect your creative content while making it sound natural.

## 1. Data Collection & Usage
**Humanize AI** is designed to process and refine text.
*   **Processing**: When you humanize text, it is sent to the **Deceptioner API** for re-phrasing. This communication is encrypted via HTTPS.
*   **No Long-Term Storage**: We do not store your original or humanized text on our servers once the processing is complete.
*   **No Tracking**: We do not use analytics or tracking cookies to monitor your browsing behavior.

## 2. Permissions & Justification
*   `storage`: Used to save your extension settings and theme preferences locally.
*   `sidePanel`: Required to provide a persistent workspace for text refinement without covering your active webpage.
*   `declarativeNetRequest`: Used to ensure secure and optimized communication with the humanization engine.
*   `host_permissions`: Required specifically to communicate with `deceptioner.site` for the humanization logic.

## 3. Transparency
We do not sell your content or data. The extension exists solely to improve the flow and undetectability of your AI-generated text.

## 4. Security
All core logic is contained within the extension package. We utilize secure, encrypted channels for all external API calls.

## 5. Contact
