## 🚀 Make AI Undetectable

**Humanize AI** is the ultimate tool for content creators, students, and professionals who use AI generating tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. While AI produces great content, it often leaves a "robotic" footprint that is easily flagged by AI detectors. 

Our extension uses advanced re-phrasing algorithms through the **Deceptioner API** to inject human-like variability, nuance, and rhythm into your text, making it sound natural and bypassing popular AI detection systems (GPTZero, Originality.ai, Turnitin, etc.).
