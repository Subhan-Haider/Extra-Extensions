## 🚀 Your Personal Free Game Radar

**LootOps** is a high-performance "Tactical HUD" for gamers who want to build an elite library without spending a dime. It actively monitors the **Epic Games Store** and **Steam** for limited-time free game drops, ensuring you're the first to know when luxury loot is available.

Equipped with a background "Service Worker" and real-time "Alarms," LootOps does the surveillance for you so you can focus on playing, not searching.

## 📖 Tactical Workflow

### 🛰️ Setting Up Surveillance

2.  **Toggle Alerts**: Ensure notifications are enabled in your browser settings.
