## Product Details

**Title:** LootOps: Epic & Steam Games

**Summary:** Tactical HUD for free games. LootOps tracks every free loot drop from Epic Games and Steam.

**Description:**
**SECURE HIGH-VALUE GAME ASSETS. ZERO COST.**

LootOps is not just a reminder tool; it is your advance scout for digital game deals. Designed with a high-density tactical interface ("Nebula HUD"), this extension stays fast, silent, and hidden until high-value intel arrives.

**MISSION CAPABILITIES:**

📡 **Epic Games Interception**
Automatically tracks the current weekly free games and upcoming "Supply Drops" on the Epic Games Store. Never miss a Thursday reset again.

🚂 **Steam Discovery Protocol**
Scans for hidden 100% off "Keep Forever" promotions on Steam. If a developer makes a paid game free for a limited time, LootOps will secure the target.

🔔 **Real-Time Intelligence**
Receive immediate "Supply Drop" notifications the moment a price hits $0.00.
*   **Instant Alerts:** "New Supply Drop Detected"
*   **Tactical Briefing:** Notifications list the exact game titles available.

🖥️ **Tactical Dashboard**
*   **Premium Aesthetics:** A stunning glass-morphic UI with advanced blur effects.
*   **Adaptive Camouflage:** Automatically switches between **Studio Obsidian** (Dark Mode) for night ops and **Apple Snow** (Light Mode) for day usage.
*   **Status Indicators:** Smart countdown timers warn you of expiring offers (White = Stable, Orange = Urgent, Red = Critical).

**Why Install?**
LootOps is built for the gamer who wants a professional, clutter-free tool. No ads, no bloat—just pure actionable intel on free games.
