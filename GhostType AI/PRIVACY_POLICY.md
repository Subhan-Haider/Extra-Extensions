# Privacy Policy for GhostType AI

**Effective Date: February 5, 2026**

At **GhostType AI**, we provide powerful automation while maintaining elite privacy standards.

## 1. Data Collection & Usage
**GhostType AI** is an undetectable typing engine built for privacy.
*   **No Centralized Logging**: We do not log the text you type or the websites where you use the extension.
*   **API Security**: When you use AI features (via OpenRouter, TextSynth, or HuggingFace), your text is sent directly to those providers. We do not sit in the middle of these connections.
*   **Local Keys**: Your API keys are stored locally in your browser's encrypted storage and never sent to our servers.

## 2. Permissions & Justification
*   `storage`: Used to save your API keys, typing speed settings, and custom Ghost Engine configurations locally.
*   `activeTab` & `scripting`: Required to perform the automated typing actions on your currently active tab. 
*   `host_permissions`: Required to communicate directly with AI providers (OpenRouter, HuggingFace, etc.) to generate or refine text.

## 3. Transparency
GhostType AI does not use tracking scripts or analytics. We do not participate in advertising networks. Your data is purely used for the single purpose of high-speed automation.

## 4. Security
Every line of code is local to the extension. We do not use remote code execution to prevent unauthorized access to your browser environment.

## 5. Contact
