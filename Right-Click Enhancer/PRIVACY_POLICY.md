# Privacy Policy for Right-Click Enhancer

## Data Collection
This extension does NOT collect any personal data or browsing history. All processing happens locally on your device.

## Storage
Settings and configurations are stored using `chrome.storage.local`, which stays within your browser profile and is not synced or uploaded to any third-party servers.

## AI Usage (if applicable)
Extensions that utilize AI features send text data to configured AI providers (like OpenRouter) only when triggered by the user. This data is not stored by the extension after processing.
