## 🚀 Reclaim Your Digital Attention

**Simple Ad Blocker** is a modern, lightweight browser extension engineered to restore the web to its original state: fast, clean, and content-focused. Unlike "heavyweight" ad blockers that consume massive amounts of system memory, Simple Ad Blocker uses an optimized filtering engine to strip away ads without slowing down your computer.

In an era of invasive digital marketing, Simple Ad Blocker stands as a minimalist shield, protecting your screen space and your privacy.

## ✨ Main Features

### 🛡️ Smart Blocking Engine
*   **Ad Network Neutralizer**: Automatically identifies and collapses common ad containers from major networks.
*   **Pop-up Prevention**: Stops annoying pop-ups before they can disrupt your browsing flow.
*   **Static & Video Ads**: Targets banners, sidebar ads, and many video-related advertising elements.
*   **Cosmetic Filtering**: Not just blocking data, but cleaning up the layout so you don't see empty "white boxes" where ads used to be.

### ⚡ Performance & Efficiency
*   **Lower RAM Usage**: Designed to stay under 5MB of background memory usage—ideal for laptops and older systems.
*   **Faster Page Loads**: By preventing heavy ad scripts and 4K banner images from even starting to download, pages feel significantly faster.
*   **Data Savings**: Perfect for users on limited data plans or slow connections.

### 🎯 Intuitive User Interface
*   **Live Block Counter**: Real-time stats available with a single click on the extension icon.
*   **Zero-Config Setup**: Works instantly out of the box with no complex filter lists to maintain or update manually.
