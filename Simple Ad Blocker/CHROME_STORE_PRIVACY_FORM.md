# Chrome Web Store Privacy Form - Simple Ad Blocker

## SINGLE PURPOSE

**Single purpose description:**
Blocks common ads on websites.

This extension serves a single, well-defined purpose: blocks common ads on websites. The extension does not perform any unrelated functions and all requested permissions are strictly necessary to fulfill this core functionality.

## PERMISSION JUSTIFICATION

**Other permissions:**
- **activeTab**: Required to access the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension icon, enabling the extension to read and modify the current page's content only when explicitly invoked.
- **scripting**: Required to inject JavaScript or CSS into web pages to modify content, add features, or enhance user experience.

**Host permission justification:**
This extension requires access to the following domains to perform its core functionality:

- <all_urls>

These host permissions are essential for the extension to:
- Access and read page content when the user explicitly invokes the extension
- Inject necessary scripts or styles to enhance functionality
- Communicate with specific web services required for the extension's operation
- Modify page content as part of the extension's single purpose

All host access is used exclusively for the extension's stated purpose and no data is collected or transmitted without user consent.
