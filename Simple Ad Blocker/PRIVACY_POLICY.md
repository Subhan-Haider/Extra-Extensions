# Privacy Policy for Simple Ad Blocker

**Effective Date: February 5, 2026**

At **Simple Ad Blocker**, we are committed to providing a cleaner web while protecting your privacy.

## 1. Zero Data Collection
**Simple Ad Blocker** follows a strict "Zero-Knowledge" policy. 
*   **No Tracking**: We do not track the websites you visit, the links you click, or the ads you block.
*   **No User Profiles**: We do not create user profiles or collect any personally identifiable information.
*   **No Cloud Sync**: All blocking logic and filtering counts are processed locally on your machine.

## 2. Permissions & Justification
*   `activeTab` & `scripting`: These permissions are used solely to identify and remove advertising elements from the websites you choose to browse.
*   `content_scripts`: Allows the extension to run blocking logic automatically on webpages to provide immediate protection.

## 3. Transparency
We do not sell user data. We do not have "Acceptable Ads" or paid whitelists. Our only goal is to remove intrusive content from your browsing experience.

## 4. Security
All blocking logic is contained within the extension package. We do not fetch remote scripts or external filter lists that could compromise your security.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about our privacy practices, please open an issue on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Subhan-Haider/Extra-Extensions).
